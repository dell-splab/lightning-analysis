In order to fully understand the research questions, it is necessary to check the Jupyter notebooks in sequence.

Each of the following folders contains different research fronts that we will be attacking. And each one refers to a problematic aspect concerning Lightning reports.

| Problematic Feature | Lightning logs | Description |
|-|-|-|
| errors | LightningError | error trends, regions, components, dashboards etc |
| page load time | LightningPageView | application time, effective page page |
